# Golang learning

my Golang challenge journey repository.

Getting started with <https://roadmap.sh/golang> here, and to follow a few simple tutorial to master the basic, and get some confidence about it.

## tips

```sh

# this is compile and test run, need the dot (current folder)
go run .
# this would help adding the module
go mod tidy
```
